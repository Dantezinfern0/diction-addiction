# Diction Addiction
This is a Dictionary app.  I was playing around with displaying data from an API.  On the page I have an area designated for indicating whther or not a word is offensive.  This data comes from the API and I thought it was interesting so I decided to play around with it.  I used a little JS trick to add classes depending on the data that gets returned.  This effectively turns the background red if the word information returned deems that word offensive.

There are still some bugs to it involving the user typing in garbage.  In the future I plan to explore the solution to that problem and possibly get this code optimized to be a widget or component I can add to another project.
